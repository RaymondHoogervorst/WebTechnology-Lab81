                  There is no real important sequence. The main operation
                  provided to users is the form to enter products. Each field
                  in this form has a placeholder text.

                  Background color is used to provide live form validation.
                  The color changes when ever a user leaves a field. There is still
                  a prompt warning when you try to submit incorrect fields.
