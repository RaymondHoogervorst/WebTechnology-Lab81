                  The info is divided into clear section tags.
                  There is no really important sequence. The main operation
                  provided to users is the form to enter products. Each field
                  in this form has a placeholder text.

                  Background color is used to provide live form validation.
                  The color changes when ever a user leaves a field. There is still
                  a prompt warning when you try to submit incorrect fields.

                  The site only has 1 webpage. And a navigation bar exists to skip to
                  each section of the webpage. The sequence order on the form goes first to
                  the input fields and then to the submit button. After that the reset button.
                  The focus is visible (at least on Google Chrome).
                  All links that go to an external source have either text before
                  them of what they are (email and tel) or have an alt to the linking image.
                  Each section has a header.
