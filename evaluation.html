         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>
            In this high level overview we will review the webpage
            made for Max Market based on certain WCAG accesebility
            requirements and feedback given by our TA Daniel KÃ¶ves.
            First we will briefly discuss the results of our evaluation,
            and after that a plan to improve the page based on the evaluation.

            You can find the actual feedback recieved in appendix A and B,
            containing an evaluation of the WCAG guidelines and the TA feedback
            respectivley.

         <h2>Improvement plan</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Fix bad line break in code. (Already done before evaluation)</li>
         </ol>
         <ol>
            <li>Provide small text warning if field is filled in incorrectly</li>
         </ol>
         <ol>
            <li>Find ways to implement part of the missing css attributes</li>
         </ol>
         <p>
            We try to find uses for as much of the remaining css attributes as we can,
            but will avoid adding too much content for that. To minimize risk
            of adding content that does not comply with WCAG after we have evaluated
            it.

                  The info is divided into clear section tags.
                  There is no really important sequence. The main operation
                  provided to users is the form to enter products. Each field
                  in this form has a placeholder text.

               <td>
                  Background color is used to provide live form validation.
                  The color changes when ever a user leaves a field. There is still
                  a prompt warning when you try to submit incorrect fields.

                  The site only has 1 webpage. And a navigation bar exists to skip to
                  each section of the webpage. The sequence order on the form goes first to
                  the input fields and then to the submit button. After that the reset button.
                  The focus is visible (at least on Google Chrome).
                  All links that go to an external source have either text before
                  them of what they are (email and tel) or have an alt to the linking image.
                  Each section has a header.
